## 4. Step-by-Step Flow

### 4.1 Main ("Happy") Path

**Cross-Chain Purchase with Insurance:**
1. **Pre-condition**: Buyer on Chain A, Machine on Chain B
2. Buyer initiates cross-chain purchase via bridge
3. AI Oracle provides:
   - Dynamic pricing recommendation
   - Risk assessment
   - Insurance quote
4. System executes:
   - Bridge tokens from Chain A to B
   - Purchase insurance coverage
   - Lock collateral in insurance pool
   - Execute ZK-proof for privacy
5. Machine network coordinates:
   - Inventory verification across network
   - Optimal fulfillment routing
   - Logistics partner notification
6. DeFi integration:
   - Unused funds to yield protocols
   - Insurance premiums to coverage pools
   - Liquidity provision rewards
7. **Post-condition**: Insured NFT on buyer's chain, yields accumulating

**Autonomous Network Operations:**
1. **Pre-condition**: Network of N machines operational
2. AI system continuously:
   - Monitors demand patterns
   - Predicts inventory needs
   - Optimizes pricing curves
   - Rebalances liquidity
3. Network consensus:
   - Validates AI recommendations
   - Votes on parameter updates
   - Distributes rewards
4. Automatic execution:
   - Inventory transfers between machines
   - Price adjustments
   - Fee rebalancing
   - Yield harvesting
5. **Post-condition**: Self-optimizing network state

**Insurance Claim Process:**
1. **Pre-condition**: Buyer holds insured NFT
2. Buyer initiates claim with evidence
3. Decentralized jury (Kleros-style):
   - Reviews evidence
   - Votes on validity
   - Stakes reputation
4. If approved:
   - Insurance payout from pool
   - Seller reputation impact
   - Network learns from incident
5. **Post-condition**: Claim resolved, system adapted

### 4.2 Alternate / Error Paths

| # | Condition | System Action | Suggested Handling |
|---|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| A1 | Bridge failure | Timeout and refund | Retry alternative bridge |
| A2 | AI oracle manipulation | Consensus override | Fallback to manual |
| A3 | Insurance pool drained | Pause new coverage | Emergency liquidity |
| A4 | Network partition | Local operation mode | Reconcile when healed |
| A5 | Regulatory block | Geo-fence transaction | Route through compliant path |
| A6 | DeFi protocol hack | Emergency withdrawal | Insurance claim |
| A7 | Privacy proof failure | Reject transaction | Standard flow fallback |
| A8 | Coordinated attack | Circuit breaker | DAO emergency response |
